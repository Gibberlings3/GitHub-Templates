## Licenses

Including a LICENSE file in your mod is a good way to let others know what they can and can't do with your mod.  Visit the [License-Templates](License-Templates) folder in this repository to find several common licenses and a guide to help you choose which one to use.

### Maintenance Permissions

It's strongly recommended that you include the file [LICENSE-MAINTENANCE.md](Maintenance-Template/LICENSE-MAINTENANCE.md) in the root directory of your repository to make it clear that maintenance updates are approved regardless of what other license your mod is using.

When using a maintenance license in combination with another license, it's recommended to include this information in your readme:

> **Copyright**
> 
> This mod is copyright (c) 2019 Author. You are allowed to submit [maintenance updates](Maintenance-Template/LICENSE-MAINTENANCE.md) for this mod. This mod is additionally licensed under [CC-BY-4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

## Badges

You can include badges at the top of the README file in your repo to quickly convey important information about your mod. You can see this in action on the [RealMod](https://github.com/Gibberlings3/RealMod) readme.
