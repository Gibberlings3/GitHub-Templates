If you don't want your mod content to be mirrored, borrowed, or altered without explicit permission, you don't have to do anything. However, you can make it clear that this is your position by including this [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) file in the root directory of your repo or by adding similar text to your readme file.

Having a [maintenance license](../../Maintenance-Template) is critical when choosing this path. It allows the community to keep the mod working once the original authors are no longer around.
