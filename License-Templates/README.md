# Choosing a License

When deciding which license to choose for your mod, you should determine whether you want others to be able to **share** (mirror) your mod and **adapt** it (change your mod content and incorporate it into other projects). The latter is crucial if you want the community to be able to help you maintain the mod.

If you do want to allow these activities, you should figure out if you want to place any conditions on them.  For example, will you permit people to include your mod content in products that can be sold for a profit?  Do you care if your work is properly attributed to you when used in another project?

Based on your answers to these questions, you should be able to find a suitable license in the tables below. Follow the link to find a LICENSE file you can include in the root directory of your repository.

**Commercial use is restricted**:

| License | Permissions |
| --- | --- |
| [Â©](All-Rights-Reserved) | None: "All rights reserved" |
| [CC-BY-NC-ND-4.0](CC-BY-NC-ND-4.0) | **_Share_** the work non-commercially (with attribution) |
| [CC-BY-NC-4.0](CC-BY-NC-4.0) | **_Share and adapt_** the work non-commercially (with attribution) |

**Commercial use is permitted**:

| License | Permissions |
| --- | --- |
| [CC-BY-ND-4.0](CC-BY-ND-4.0) | **_Share_** the work (with attribution) |
| [CC-BY-4.0](CC-BY-4.0) | **_Share and adapt_** the work (with attribution) |
| [CC0](CC0) | **_Share and adapt_** the work without attribution or any other conditions |

Do you want to promote free culture by requiring works that incorporate your mod content to use a similar license?  Consider one of the following share-alike licenses.

| License | Permissions |
| --- | --- |
| [CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0](CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0) | **_Share and adapt_** the work non-commercially so long as a similar license is used |
| [CC-BY-SA-4.0](CC-BY-SA-4.0) | **_Share and adapt_** the work so long as a similar license is used |

## Free Software Licenses

You may have heard that the Creative Commons licenses are not designed for code, and a free software license may be more appropriate. This is good advice for most software, but I don't think it's applicable to many WeiDU mods.  Our "source code" is comprised of .tp2 scripts written for WeiDU to interpret.  We don't have to worry about software patents or what should happen when our code is compiled into a binary.

That being said, if you wish to include content in your mod from something that is using a copyleft license like the GPL or LGPL, then you may need to use a similar license.  I'll list here several popular free software licenses and their approximate permissions, as I understand them.

| License | Permissions | CC Equivalent |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GPL | **_Share and adapt_** the work so long as a similar license is used | [CC-BY-SA-4.0](CC-BY-SA-4.0) |
| LGPL | **_Share and adapt_** the work so long as a similar license is used | [CC-BY-SA-4.0](CC-BY-SA-4.0) |
| MIT | **_Share and adapt_** the work (with attribution) | [CC-BY-4.0](CC-BY-4.0) |
| Apache | **_Share and adapt_** the work (with attribution) | [CC-BY-4.0](CC-BY-4.0) |
| Unlicense | **_Share and adapt_** the work without attribution or any other conditions | [CC0](CC0) |
